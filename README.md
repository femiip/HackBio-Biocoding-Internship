# HackBio-Biocoding-Internship
For the stage zero task, we were required to write a code in the specified language of our choosing, stating details such as: team name, member name, country/location, hobbies, email address, discipline and our preferred programming language.
I chose to use the dictionary method as it seemed the most straightforward, but maybe longer procedure.
At the end, i used a print statement which i do not fully understand yet. However, i understand that the .items() function helps to display a list of the dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.
I am excited to learn more as I progress in this Bioinformatics internship. 
Thank you, HackBio!

For the stage one task, we were given three different tasks
Task one was to create a function that translates a DNA sequence to protein
Task two was to create a function for calculating logistic population growth rate
Task three involved creating a function that calculates the Hamming distance between our slack and twitter usernames
